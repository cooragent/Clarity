**3. Relative Strength Index (RSI):**

### Conclusion and Insights
The combination of sound moving averages (50 SMA and 200 SMA trend upwards), a positive MACD suggesting bullish momentum, and a neutral RSI points towards a favorable trading environment for NVDA. The current ATR indicates traders to prepare for swings, allowing for strategic risk management.

As the stock approaches its 10 EMA but remains slightly above the 50 SMA, traders may look to enter positions or adjust their stop-loss orders upward, thus capitalizing on potential continued upward price action.
